Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but often misaligned with human expectations. Traditionally, *Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)* has been used to fix this, but RLHF is costly, unstable, and requires building a separate reward model.

**Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)** is a simpler alternative.

---

## Why DPO?

- **RLHF workflow**: generate responses → humans rank them → train a reward model → use reinforcement learning (PPO) to optimize.  
- **Problems**: unstable training, reward hacking, high compute cost, and complex pipelines.  

DPO eliminates the reward model and reinforcement learning step, making training more direct and efficient.

## How DPO Works

1. **Generate pairs of responses**: For a given prompt, the model produces two answers.  
2. **Human preference**: Annotators choose the better response.  
3. **Direct optimization**: Instead of training a reward model, DPO applies a simple classification loss (cross-entropy) so the model increases probability of preferred responses and decreases probability of rejected ones.

## Key Advantages

- **Simpler training**: No reward model, no PPO.  
- **Stable and efficient**: Uses standard supervised training tools.  
- **Better alignment**: Matches or outperforms RLHF on tasks like summarization and dialogue quality.  
- **Cheaper to run**: Less compute and fewer moving parts.  

---

## When to Use DPO

- Aligning LLMs to tone, style, or politeness.  
- Improving summarization or dialogue coherence.  
- Any setting where you want stable, human-aligned fine-tuning without heavy reinforcement learning.

## Takeaway

DPO reframes alignment: *your LLM is its own reward model*. By directly learning from human preferences, we can achieve alignment that’s both **simpler and more effective** than traditional RLHF.
